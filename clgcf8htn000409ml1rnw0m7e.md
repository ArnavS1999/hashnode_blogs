## **What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a cultural and collaborative mindset that emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, and automation between development and operations teams to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.

DevOps is not a specific job title or role, but rather a set of practices and principles that can be applied across a variety of roles in software development and IT operations. Anyone involved in the software development and delivery process can adopt a DevOps mindset and apply DevOps practices in their work, including developers, testers, operations engineers, product managers, and others.

## **What is Automation?**

DevOps automation is a set of technologies and tools that perform repeatable tasks and routine jobs that software or product engineers would else do manually. It also closes the loops and gaps of feedback and requests from the operations to the development team and vice versa.  Automating development tasks throughout an (SDLC) helps operations teams and app development teams collaborate. 

Such collaborations could be for anything in the DevOps cycle, like continuous improvement of designs, build versions, tests, releases, deploys, and tracking of software applications. This is also equally applicable to products and services development lifecycles. 

## **What is Scaling?**

DevOps in a scaling environment is defined as an automation-driven environment for the establishment of DevOps culture and choosing of appropriate tools. Companies will take different approaches to accomplish DevOps culture, but scale introduces additional complexities that can make adopting DevOps a challenge. Once you start scaling DevOps across tens or hundreds of projects, you’ll want to set up a central function to support DevOps and establish some basic ground rules for teams interested in moving faster and taking more ownership of operations.

## **What is Infrastructure?**

In the context of DevOps, Infrastructure refers to the concept that revolves around the idea of managing infrastructure with the help of automation and configuration management tools. This is done with the help of certain tools or programs which can help to carry out the tasks automatically. Managing infrastructure in this way can help to improve the reliability, scalability, and security of the infrastructure.
